## MIIA Pothole Image Classification Challenge

This knowledge challenge was designed for Leaderex and AI Expo, taking place on 3 and 4 September 2019, respectively. This competition is open to anyone and will remain open to allow the Zindi community to learn and test their skills.

Potholes have become a huge problem for most drivers. With the South African government spending over R22 billion over the past 3 years on pothole repair programs and the Automobile Association(AA) acknowledging more than 5% of road deaths to unmaintained road structure (potholes).

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to accurately predict the likelihood that an image contains a pothole.

#### Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this challenge is the Area Under the Curve.

The label is the likelihood that the image contains a pothole. Values can be from 0 to 1.
